# Computational Linguistics


In this repo, I apply various statistical methods (Bayesian) and neural networks in Python to analyze and examine relevant topics within computational linguistics. This was part of a 400-level course designed for us to engage in interdisciplinary methods to investigate linguistic phenomena. 

Each problem set includes an .ipynb file that can only be opened and run on Jupyter Notebook. The following is the topic of each problem set:

Problem Set 1:

1.1 - Neural Networks and Back Propagation
1.2 - Beta Distribution and Homophones
1.3 - Surprisal (Bayesian Methods)

Problem Set 2:

2.1 - Semantic Representations
2.2 - Semantic Networks
2.3 - Noun Classes in Tsez

Problem Set 3 (3.3 was cancelled):

3.1 - Cross-linguistic Color Representations
3.2 - Bilingual Semantic Networks

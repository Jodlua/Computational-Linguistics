    "The cell labeled Part 0 below contains the code you should run to read in the English and Dutch monolingual data from the Small World of Words (SWOW), which will create a semantic network for each language.  These two semantic networks, in `eng_graph` and `dut_graph`, will form the basis for your bilingual semantic network (which you'll join with translation links in part (a) below).\n",

    "The code here also reads in the human bilingual FA data from VHDG, and creates a graph structure for that data as well.  These graphs **will not be used as part of your semantic networks**, but rather will serve as \"gold standard\" data reflecting the human bilingual associations to which you'll compare the output of the bilingual semantic network you create.\n",

    "You'll model the free association task as a random walk.  Unlike in Problem Set 2.2, where a random walk had many steps so it could generate a sequence of words in a category (ie, a list of 'animals'), **here a random walk will traverse a single association link**.  If you stayed in the English network and ran the random walk over, say, 1000 trials for each English cue, then you'd get a distribution of 1000 single responses to each cue, which would match those of monolingual speakers of English.\n",

Do a random \"translation\" walk from the English cue into Dutch, then do a random \"association\" walk from the Dutch translation (within the Dutch network), then do a random \"translation\" walk from the Dutch response back to English, and output that English response.
